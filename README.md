 I'm aspiring FrontEnd Developer. 
 I learn with help of the GOIT Academy.
 Happy to announce that I completed my first project. 
 You can see my whole journey from goit-markup-hw-01 all the way down to goit-markup-hw-08 or check the final result (8th part).
 Currently I am preparing to my first team project. So excited ðŸ˜„
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on HTML&CSS projects.
