# FrontEnd Developer Enthusiast ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm on a journey to become a seasoned FrontEnd Developer, and I've been honing my skills with the amazing resources at GOIT Academy. Teamwork brings a whole new dynamic to the development process, and the results are pretty darn good, if I may say so myself.

## Check out Team Projects I was involed in:
1. [IceCream Team Project](https://github.com/pawelszopinski/icecream-team-goit)  [Project Demo](https://marlenawojtczak.github.io/projekt-grupa-4/)
  
2. [Moviepedia](https://github.com/pawelszopinski/Project-07)  [Project Demo](https://raffamieczkowski.github.io/Project-07/)

Since my last update, I've been keeping the momentum going:

1. Collaborated on a Movies App project with my team. It's a nifty movie search application with API integration and features like a queue and watched list.

2. Built a solo project using React â€“ a "Phone Book" application. It's been a great exercise in applying my skills independently.

3. Currently, I'm putting the finishing touches on a backend project using Node.js + MongoDB. This robust application handles contact databases with features like Express.js, Mongoose, authentication, authorization, email handling, and it's all Dockerized.

## Learning from Udemy Courses:
I've been actively engaged in Udemy courses to deepen my understanding:

- Progressing through "Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann, gaining a solid foundation in JavaScript.

- Progressing through "100 Days of JS" by Zino, reinforcing and applying my JavaScript skills through daily challenges.
